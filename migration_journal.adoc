= RH-PAM 7 -> Kogito Migration Journal

== Purpose
Purpose of this document is to maintain a history of the migration effort of ER-Demo's _process-service_ from RH-PAM 7 (embedded in SpringBoot) to Kogito.

== Summary

. Accessibility of process variables
+
Kogito provides direct reference to process variables from process tasks and conditionals.
For example, instead of the following used in a BPMN2 for RH-PAM 7 :
+
-----
<![CDATA[Boolean _isAvailable = (Boolean)kcontext.getVariable("responderIsAvailable");
return (_isAvailable);]]>
-----
+
the following can instead be written with a BPMN2 that runs in Kogito:
+
-----
return responderIsAvailable;
-----

. Process Id needs to facilitate auto-generation of Java class files
+
Kogito auto-generates Java class files from the _processId_ of a BPMN2.
Subsequently, the processId needs to be of a simple String convention with no special characters.


== Journal Details

. *25 September 2020*
.. IncidentProcessTest
+
Added first draft of this class by copying and pruning:  _org.acme.travel.MessagingIT.java_
.. Add the following dependency in project pom:
+
-----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
      <artifactId>kogito-test-utils</artifactId>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

.. [red]#Unable to run junit test do to _test-containers_ dependency on docker#
+
-----
ERROR: ping failed with configuration Environment variables, system properties and defaults. Resolved dockerHost=unix:///var/run/docker.sock due to org.rnorth.ducttape.TimeoutException: Timeout waiting for result with exception

... In my dev environment, I only use podman, buildah and skopeo
... Need to research progress using _test-containers_ suite and podman

.... https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/2088
.... https://lists.podman.io/archives/list/podman@lists.podman.io/thread/5K6ZOTYDISZEXCHWJJD3RFNKM33NHEDI/

. *24 September 2020*

.. Upgrade to kogito 0.15.0 (which also bumped quarkus to: 1.8.0 )

.. Temporarily stub RESTful service tasks in _incident-process_ BPMN2 until a (Fuse / Camel based) ServiceTask capability is available in Kogito
+
Use the following as examples:

*** https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-travel-agency/basic#business-logic
*** https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/blob/stable/kogito-travel-agency/basic/src/main/java/org/acme/travels/service/FlightBookingService.java

.. [red]#Kogito docs currently not helpful with creating custom Service Tasks#
.. [red]#Kogito docs currently not helpful with updating the BPMN2 to reference new Service Tasks#


.. Business Rule Task
... RH-PAM implemention of Incident Process implements link:https://github.com/Emergency-Response-Demo/process-service/blob/master/src/main/java/com/redhat/cajun/navy/process/wih/BusinessRuleTaskHandlerWrapper.java[a custom WIH] to execute business rules.  This is a wrapper around the OOTB BusinessRuleTask.
... [red]#TO-DO:#  investigate why not the use of the OOTB BusinessRuleTaskHandler directly.
... link:https://github.com/Emergency-Response-Demo/cajun-navy-rules/blob/master/src/main/resources/com.redhat.cajun.navy.rules/IncidentResponderAssignment.drl[IncidentResponderAssignment] technical rules do not have a ruleflow-group associated with them.
... Subsequently, the following build-time exception is thrown when compiling the business process with a BusinessRuleTask and empty _RuleFlowGroup_ field:
+
-----
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Rule task "Assign Mission" is invalid: you did not set a unit name, a rule flow group or a decision model
-----

... Will modify all IncidentResponderAssignment rules to include a RuleFlowGroup



.. Define all outgoing and incoming Kafka topic connectors in:   src/main/resources/application.properties

.. IntermediateThrowEvent:

... Should the _message_ field be populated with the kafka topic name (as defined in application.properties ) ?
+
At authoring time, the previously defined kafka connectors (in application.properties) do not populate drop downs in intermediateThrow and intermediateCatch events of BPMN2.   Are they suppose to ?

... In _travels.bpmn2_, what is _Message_5_Input_ ?

... No *OnEntry Action*
+
Prior to _Incident Un-Assignment Event_, will need to introduce a script task

.. IntermediateCatchEvent

... How to filter out irrelevant messages that may be sent to topics that IntermediateCatchEvent is listening on ?
... How will the auto-generated process the incoming message and invoke the correct signal along with the correct corresponding payload ? ie:  link:https://github.com/Emergency-Response-Demo/process-service/blob/master/src/main/java/com/redhat/cajun/navy/process/message/listeners/ResponderUpdatedEventMessageListener.java#L80[ResponderUpdatedEventMessageListener]

.. Modified _incident-process_ as follows:

. *15 September 2020*
+
.. New _process-service-quarkus_ project created without issues using the kogito maven archetype as follows:
+
-----
mvn archetype:generate \
        -DinteractiveMode=false \
        -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie.kogito \
        -DarchetypeArtifactId=kogito-quarkus-archetype \
        -DarchetypeVersion=0.14.0 \
        -DgroupId=com.redhat.cajun.navy \
        -DartifactId=process-service-kogito \
        -Dversion=0.0.1
-----

.. Kogito project to double as kjar
+
In RH-PAM 7 based _process-service_, a separate _incident-process-jar_ (containing the link:https://github.com/Emergency-Response-Demo/incident-process-kjar/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/redhat/cajun/navy/process/incident-process.bpmn[incident-process.bpmn] ) is imported as a dependency.  With Kogito, it's a best practice to version control process and rules artifacts in the same kogito based business service.  Subsequently, _incident-process.bpmn_ was copied to the resources directory of _process-service-kogito_.
+
Original process definition is as follows:
+
image::images/incident-process.png[]

.. [red]#Compilation errors with _process-service-kogito_#
+
... link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-3353[KOGITO-3353]
... processId renamed from _incident-process_ to the following to allow Kogito to generate Java classes using this processId :   _incidentLifecycle_.
